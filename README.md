# advent of code (python)

Python solutions to the advent of code problems (https://adventofcode.com).

While this project uses python, I personally use the `pypy3` python interpreter for most solutions due to better runtimes.
The formatting is done using the python formatter `black`.

Common libraries used as part of the solutions are: `math`, `copy`, `numpy`, `re`, `string`, `networkx`, `json`.
